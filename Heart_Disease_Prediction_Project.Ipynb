    "> # **Heart Disease Prediction Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, a scholarship provided by the Ministry of Information Technology and Communication. Under the guidance of our instructor, **Ahmed Moustafa**, our team—**Ahmed Elsayed**, **Ammar Osama**, **Moustafa Alaa**, and **Mahmoud Mohamed Helmy**—aims to develop a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to leverage data science techniques, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient features. By analyzing the dataset, we hope to uncover key insights into which factors contribute most significantly to heart disease, and subsequently build an effective machine learning model to forecast its occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are key features in the dataset used to predict heart disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The age of the patient in years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sex**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The gender of the patient.  \n",
    "     - `0` = Male  \n",
    "     - `1` = Female  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chest Pain Type**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The type of chest pain experienced by the patient.  \n",
    "     - `1` = Typical angina (related to reduced blood supply to the heart)  \n",
    "     - `2` = Atypical angina (chest pain not related to the heart)  \n",
    "     - `3` = Non-anginal pain (chest pain unrelated to the heart)  \n",
    "     - `4` = Asymptomatic (no chest pain)  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resting Blood Pressure (BP)**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The patient’s resting blood pressure, measured in mm Hg.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cholesterol Levels**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The serum cholesterol level of the patient, measured in mg/dL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS > 120)**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: A binary feature that indicates whether the patient's fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dL.  \n",
    "     - `1` = True (FBS > 120)  \n",
    "     - `0` = False (FBS ≤ 120)  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Max Heart Rate (Max HR)**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The maximum heart rate achieved by the patient during a stress test, measured in beats per minute (bpm).  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Exercise-Induced Angina**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: A binary feature indicating whether the patient experiences angina (chest pain) during physical activity.  \n",
    "     - `1` = Yes  \n",
    "     - `0` = No  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **ST Depression**  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The difference in ST segment elevation between rest and exercise, measured in mm. The ST segment is part of an electrocardiogram (ECG). ST depression during exercise suggests that part of the heart is not getting enough oxygen, a condition known as ischemia, which is a strong indicator of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **Project Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  \n",
    "   - We will start by understanding the dataset, visualizing distributions, and examining relationships between variables.\n",
    "   - Through statistical analysis, we aim to identify key risk factors for heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Learning (ML)**:  \n",
    "   - After EDA, we will develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.\n",
    "   - We will experiment with various classification algorithms, evaluate model performance, and optimize accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project not only provides a practical application of data science methodologies but also highlights the importance of predictive analytics in healthcare. By using historical patient data, we aim to aid in early detection and prevention of heart disease, potentially contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
